### What I learned

While building this component, I practiced creating a clean and centered card layout using Flexbox and improved my understanding of spacing, shadows, and typography.  
I also learned how to make hover states consistent with the design and use reusable CSS variables for colors and font sizes.

```css
:root {
  --pale-blue: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
  --bright-blue: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
  --very-pale-blue: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
  --desaturated-blue: hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
  --dark-blue: hsl(223, 47%, 23%);
}
